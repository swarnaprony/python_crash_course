When you love someone, it’s important to tell them. To give them the words and let them know just how important they are to you. But for many of us, explaining how we feel can be hard and the right words don’t always come out the way we mean. These I love you paragraphs are examples of ways you can tell someone you care about them. You can send them in a card, text message, email, or a letter. Use them as inspiration for your own paragraphs, borrow sections and tweak them to make them your ow, or add details from you own life and relationship to make it even more personal.

Taking the time to write out an I love you paragraph, will show your boyfriend or husband just how much he means to you. Because telling someone you love them is about so much more than three little words.

Here are over 30 love paragraphs for him to inspire your own I love you paragraphs:


I know we say I love you a lot. In the morning when we wake up, on our way out the door, sometimes when we say goodbye over the phone. We say I love you when something bad happens and we want to let the other person know I’m here for you, we say I love you when one of the kids does something cute or ridiculous. Sometimes, I know, we say I love you when we’re really annoyed with each other. Sometimes we say it after a fight. Other times we say it after making love. We say I love you a lot. I value each and every I love you. They are three little words said so many times and so many different ways and they all add up to a story of our love together and what it means. I wanted to add one more I love you to the bunch—an I love you to let you know that I’m paying attention. When I say I love you and you say I love you too it still means so much to me. It’s such a part of our every days lives, but I’ll never take it for granted. I love you.

I wanted to take the time to tell you just how much you mean to me. You’ve become a rock in my life, something solid and secure I can lean on. Knowing you’re by my side makes me so eternally grateful, that I can hardly put it into words. I had felt happiness before, but nothing prepared me for the happiness I feel when I’m with you.

“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.” – Pablo Neruda

I love you in a place where there’s no space or time. My love is everlasting, ever growing, and ever present. My love for you knows no bounds. I was drawn to you and your soul in a way I can’t explain. It was like I just knew, here he is. This is it. He is it. You’ll never know how much you mean to me. I can only tell you that my soul will love you forever.

It started with wanting to spend more time with you. I wasn’t even sure what it was back then, just this feeling I had of wanting more. More time, more information about you, more of your presence in general. I’d make excuses to see you, to ask you questions, to come up to you at events, to be in the same place at the same time. I didn’t know it was love then, I just knew I had to find a way to be around you. It was such a simple need. And it still is. I need you in my life. I need to be around you. Your presence, your smile, your very self. You make me so happy.

Sometimes you and I seem like a wild dream, but it’s a dream I want to come true. It seems so impossible. That I should find you, the one other person in this world who fits me so completely and who makes me so happy. Sometimes when we’re together, I’ll look over and you’ll be doing something small—something silly like looking for something to eat in the fridge or scratching your back maybe—and that one small thing causes this surge in my heart. I can’t believe I’m the person who gets to share these moments with you, these small, seemingly-insignificant moments. I never thought this would be what my wildest dream would be like, but I’m so glad they’ve come true.

A couple looking at birds flying into the sunset with the love paragraph below spelled out in the sky.

You’re my best friend. The person I can tell all my secrets to, the first person I want to talk to when I wake up, and last person I want to talk to before I drift off to sleep. When something good happens to me, you’re the first person I want to tell. When I’m troubled by something or if I get bad news, you’re the one I go to for comfort and support. But you’re so much more to me than a friend, or someone who helps me through tough times, you’re the love of my life. You’re my friend, my lover, my comfort, and my strength. I am so lucky to have you.
